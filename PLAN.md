# Granite completeness plan

Work in branch `granite-completeness`. Prioritize semantic correctness over
optimization. Each coherent change needs executed regression coverage, a
changelog entry, reference-manual review, and build/test validation. Update this
checklist as work lands. Compiler fixes must conform to documented Harding
semantics; any intended language change must be explicit and documented.

## Baseline

- [x] Bounded execution-parity runner with isolated workspace build artifacts.
- [x] Nested output-directory imports.
- [x] Class-side method extraction, registration, receivers, aliases and factories.
- [x] Class-side `super` lookup in the interpreter.
- [x] Seven executed parity cases and class-model unit tests passing.
- [ ] Diagnose the older block-parity suite's nested-control-flow hang.
- [ ] Expand parity coverage continually; do not equate interpreter-only tests
      with compiled execution coverage.

## 1. Finish class-side and accessor semantics

- [x] Preserve defining-class ownership for inherited methods and `super`.
- [x] Test class-side `super` in nested blocks.
- [x] Test multi-level constructor inheritance.
- [x] Register dynamically dispatched generated accessors as compiled methods,
      respecting read/write permissions and user-defined overrides.

## 2. Correct closure semantics

- [x] Share mutable capture cells instead of copying independent values.
- [x] Test sibling and nested blocks observing the same bindings.
- [x] Declare method/block temporaries before closure creation; cover captures
      preceding first assignment.
- [x] Allocate per-iteration parameter bindings in inline `do:`/`collect:`/`select:`;
      executed coverage for escaped closures from `collect:`.
- [x] Limit capture-cell name analysis to each method/block/main body.
- [x] Cover locals shadowing slots and parameters shadowing outer bindings.
- [x] Bind range-loop parameters per iteration in ascending/descending loops.
- [x] Cover declared-local shadowing in inline conditionals/repetition blocks;
      exclude block temporaries from inherited VM captures.
- [x] Cover inline `do:`/`collect:`/`select:` and both while selectors with
      lexical scopes, condition setup, side effects, and escaped loop captures.
- [ ] Replace name-based analysis with precise lexical binding identities if
      additional shadowing cases require it (current tested scopes pass).
- [x] Keep escaped block environments alive safely under ARC/ORC (managed
      environments owned by BlockNode; returned string-capture regression tested).

## Reference manual maintenance (before the next implementation milestone)

- [x] Update `docs/MANUAL.md` for verified accessor behavior (including setter
      return values), lexical shadowing, shared captures, escaped closures, and
      lexical `super` lookup.
- [x] Review `docs/QUICKREF.md` for corresponding corrections.
- [x] Distinguish intended language semantics from Granite's tested support and
      remaining limitations; link to `docs/GRANITE_STATUS.md`.
- [x] Link semantic examples to executable regression cases and add missing
      tests where manual examples expose gaps.
- [ ] Review the manual and quick reference with every coherent semantic change;
      update them in the same commit when clarification is needed.

## Nim toolchain alignment

- [x] Pin `harding.nimble` to Nim 2.2.12 and align contributor/build instructions.
- [x] Validate interpreter, Granite, generated programs, and focused tests under
      installed Nim 2.2.12. Nimble selects its installed 2.2.12 compiler; direct
      builds and Granite child builds use PATH's 2.2.12. All 23 parity cases,
      compiler tests, and class-model tests pass.

## 3. Correct non-local returns

- [x] Replace compiled method IDs with unique activation targets captured by
      block environments; deactivate targets when their invocation exits.
- [x] Test recursive callbacks and nested-loop returns; explicitly test compiled
      rejection of escaped-block returns rather than claiming VM parity.
- [x] Detect inactive compiled home targets with native BlockCannotReturnError.
- [ ] Correct VM inactive-home returns (currently treated as local returns),
      update legacy tests using escaped `^` as ordinary block results, and
      integrate compiler errors with Harding's resumable exception semantics.
- [ ] Ensure cleanup executes while unwinding.

## 4. Complete object-model dispatch

- [ ] Multiple inheritance and qualified `super`.
- [ ] Dynamic sends and reflection.
- [ ] Proper missing-message errors instead of silent nil.

## 5. Exceptions, processes and libraries

- [ ] Verify resumable exceptions using executed tests.
- [ ] Decide continuation/state-machine lowering for semantics that native
      stack execution cannot preserve.
- [ ] Compile library-heavy applications without interpreter fallback.
- [ ] Cover mixed-mode execution separately from pure compilation.

## 6. Optimize after semantic coverage

- [ ] Direct calls and specialization.
- [ ] Unboxing.
- [ ] Dispatch caching.

## Validation entry points

```sh
nimble harding
nim c -p:external -o:granite src/harding/compiler/granite.nim
nim c -r tests/test_class_model.nim
python3 scripts/test_granite_parity.py
```

Use additional focused suites for changed behavior. Full suite completion is
required before claiming full compiler parity; known hangs must not be hidden.
