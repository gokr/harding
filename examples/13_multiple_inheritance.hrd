# Multiple Inheritance Example
#
# Harding supports multiple inheritance via addSuperclass:

"=== Multiple Inheritance ===" println

# Define parent classes
Animal := Object deriveWithAccessors: #(name)
Animal>>speak [
  ^ "Some generic animal sound"
]

Pet := Object deriveWithAccessors: #(owner)
Pet>>greet [
  ^ "Hello, " , self owner , "!"
]

# Create a class with multiple parents using addSuperclass:
# Note: Define all slots in the child class to avoid conflicts
Dog := Object deriveWithAccessors: #(name owner breed)

# Override any conflicting methods before adding parents
Dog>>speak [
  ^ "Woof!"
]

Dog addSuperclass: Animal
Dog addSuperclass: Pet

# Create an instance
MyDog := Dog new
MyDog name: "Buddy"
MyDog owner: "Alice"
MyDog breed: "Golden Retriever"

"" println
"=== Testing inherited methods ===" println

("Name: " , MyDog name) println
("Owner: " , MyDog owner) println
("Breed: " , MyDog breed) println

"" println
("Speak: " , MyDog speak) println
("Greet: " , MyDog greet) println

"" println
"=== Method lookup order ===" println
"When methods conflict, the first parent's version is used." println
"In this case: Dog -> Animal -> Pet -> Object" println
